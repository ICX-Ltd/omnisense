2026-04-27
- Added prompts/ folder + workflow conventions in CLAUDE.md (prompt-file lookup, README Updates rule).
- Gitignored prompts/, CLAUDE.md, .claude/.

2026-05-04
- Tightened CHAT_RAC_OPPORTUNITY seed fragment (backend/src/modules/prompts/seed-fragments.ts):
  added MINIMUM INTENT THRESHOLD, OVERRIDE rule for new-sale journeys after lapse/service signals,
  Tesco Clubcard / payment-completion / purchase-confirmation positive signals.
- Note: seedIfMissing only inserts new rows — existing DBs need a manual update of chat.rac.opportunity.
- Operations dashboard now distinguishes "Unable to Classify" (opportunity_json present, is_opportunity NULL)
  from fully classified rows. New stat + drill-down panel in OperationsDashboard.vue, backed by a new
  "__unclassified" reason in getOpportunityMetrics / getInteractionsByOpportunityReason.
- Added diagnostic logging around the insights upsert in recordings.service.ts to capture field-length
  details when the MSSQL TDS parameter error recurs on the server.
